# Plants-Disease-Classification
This data science project aims to create a website that can classify three plants by disease. The realization of the website is divided into different steps:

- Build a CNN model using Tensorflow and train it with the Plant Village dataset from kaggle.com. (We cover almost all data science concepts such as data loading, data visualization, resizing, normalization, and data augmentation during model creation). 
-Using FastAPI and TF Serve, which use stored models to handle HTTP requests.
-Build a website with reactjs that can predict affected plant categories.
